Binaries
========

So, where can you download binaries? The ready-to-use Android app is
available on Android Market for a small fee. The proceeds of the sales 
will be donated to <a href="http://laquadrature.net">La Quadrature du Net</a> 
to help them lobby the EU for better legislation concerning (digital) civil 
rights. 

You can also build piRSS yourself but then you are basically all set to
join the development team and this is also pretty cool, eh?
