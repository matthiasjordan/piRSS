piRSS is released under the GNU GPLv3. See the file COPYING for details.


Binaries
========

So, where can you download binaries? The ready-to-use Android app is
available on Android Market.

Please consider donating to <a href="http://laquadrature.net">La Quadrature du Net</a> 
to help them lobby the EU for better legislation concerning (digital) civil 
rights. 

You can also build piRSS yourself but then you are basically all set to
join the development team and that would be pretty cool, too.
